# Notes

This is where I store my notes on processes I find particularly difficult, interesting
or obscure. If those notes helped you in any way, that is great. If you are a Nix
expert how somehow found their way in here, I only ask that you point out my mistakes
where you spot them. I am not a Nix expert, and my notes are limited to my ownknowledge.
If you spot a mistake, please let me know and I would be happy to learn from you. Thanks!
