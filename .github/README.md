## üì¶ Overview

### Notable Features
  
  - **Shared Configurations** - Reduce re-used code by sharing modules and options between hosts
  - **Fully Modular** - We extend NixOS instead of simply declaring options. 
  - **Sane Defaults** - The modules attempt to bring the most sane defaults, while providing overrides
  - **Secrets Management** - Manage secrets through Ragenix
  - **Flexible Modules** - Both system and home-manager modules allow users to bring their own configurations from anywhere
  - **Extensive Configuration** - We leave so little unconfigured. Everything is configured and ready to be accessed.
  - **Wayland Ready** - Leave Xorg in the past where it belongs. The system is fully ready for Wayland, with Xorg as fallback.
  - **Opt-in Impermanence** - Impermanence can be included anytime without interfeting with other configurations.
  - **Encryption Ready** - The system has been optimized not to interfere with disk encryption.
  - **Declarative Themes** - Through the help of `nix-colors` and `wall-pkgs`, theme your system from only your flake

## Notes

### Preface

If my configuration appears confusing to you, that is because it is confusing.
Admitably, I am not yet very well wresed in NixOS or the Nix expression language.
Thus, my configuration is severely limited by my knowledge, despite what my work may
suggest. While I may not be able to follow best Nix practices, I try to follow a particular
logic while organizing this configuration. I also attempt to document everything as
I humanly can.

The resulting configuration was based off of *many* others which I have linked below.
If you like anything about this particular repository, you will probaby be interested
in checking them out. If you like what *I* have been doing and if it's helpful to you
in any shape or form, consider leaving a star or donating to me (every bit would be appreciated)
from the links below. Up to you.

If you have anything to say or ask about those conigurations (especially if it was because
you were absolutely horrified by my atrocities against Nix or NixOS) I invite you to
create an issue on open a pull request. I am always happy to learn and improve.
Some of my mental notes (hopefully to be organized better when I finish my blog)
can be found in [the documentation](../docs/notes). Should you need explanation on 
some of the things I've done (or proofread my notes) you may take a look in there.

### Motivation

I so often switch devices due to a myriad of reasons. Regardless of the reason,
I would like to be able to get my new devices up and running in minutes. Thanks
to the declarative nature of NixOS, I can do just that on top of being able to
build entire system from a few modules and nothing more. Which is why I am currently
in the process of transitioning all of my devices to NixOS. While I do have much to learn
the NixOS ecosystem is an incredible learning opportunity and a good practice for
those who want to switch inbetween devices at ease, or have common "mixin"
configs that are shared between multiple devices. All things considered, it is
an excellent idea to learn Nix (the programming language) and NixOS.

I also maintain some dotfiles for my desktop running Arch Linux. See the [arch](../../../tree/arch)
branch if you are interested in my "legacy" dotfiles.

### Disclaimer

> I am not a NixOS _expert_. I am a NixOS _user_.

You _probably_ do not want to copy or base your config off of this configuration.
Frankly, this is not a community framework, and nor is it built with the intention of bringing
new people into NixOS or/and helping newcomers figure out how NixOS works.
It is simply my NixOS configuration, built around my personal use cases and interests.
If you do have a question, I will do my absolute best to answer it as the
circumstances (mainly my own knowledge) allow, however, do not expect "support"
and definitely do not assume this configuration to be following best practices.

Dissect the configurations all you want, take what you need and if you find yourself to
be excelling somewhere I lack, do feel free to contribute to my atrocities against
NixOS and everything it stands for. Would be appreciated.

_Styling PRs will be rejected because I like my Alejandra, thanks but no thanks._
