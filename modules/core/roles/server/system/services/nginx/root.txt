Howdy!

I'm raf, more commonly known as NotAShelf on most online spaces. This

Frequently Asked Questions

Q: What do you do for a living?

A: I am a professional sailmaker. I design, manifacture and sell sails. I also
work as a part-time Political Science instructor for the time being. Sometimes
I do digital art, other times I do sailing as a sport.

A: No, I've graduated as an International Relations major. I've been teaching
myself programming and Linux system administration since 2018. I mostly enjoy
open-source software, and my primary stack (as of now) is mostly backend
development in Go.

I don't consider noteworthy.

Idea for site design: motherfuckingwebsite.com taken to the extreme. I owe the
